        <h2>Hi :3</h2>
        <p>
           Hi I'm me and im gonna do an auto biography. My full name is Gabrielle FIONA Budiono and my birthday is on the 11th of November.
           I was born on the 11th of November, 2011, AT 11am (my dad planned that out lol). I am 14 years old this year and I go to Santa Laurensia School for middle school.
           For elementary school, I went to BINUS School Serpong but my parents wanted to push me a little harder so they moved me here. 
           I'd say I have quite a few talents and achievements. I enjoy talking (whether to other people or to myself), art, music, theatre, badminton, grinding on Cookie Run Kingdom, watching Tik Toks, reading, Japanese culture, a bit of history, a bit of language learning, and design (whether fashion or interor).
           I've been wanting to pick up on content creation as a silly story-mations YouTuber as like a side thing for fun but I can't animate for the life of me or tween which sucks :P 
           I was in the student counsil for 3 years in BINUS, I was constantly chosen for storytelling competitions (when I was like 6) and MC jobs, I was chosen to speak at the recent TED Ed Student Talks, my art was displayed in Alam Sutera Mall, my list could go on and on.
           I talk a lot about my achievements and talents like I'm boasting but I have my negatives. For the longest time, I was always the biggest girl in the class, both vertically and horizontally, aka I was lowkey a fatty. 
           My size is genetic from my mom's side and at the time, was excentuated by my baby fat, but when I hit puberty, I became super slim. I was so scared of losing that version of me to the point where I didn't want to eat much.
           That is probably the reason why my gastrisitis is so bad at my age. Not only do I have to deal with my stomach acid eating me alive, I also have to deal with my lungs closing up on me (athsma).
           I'm in a few fandoms (actively) online such as:
